Notice of Alteration
William Silversmith
May 2019, December 2023, January 2025

- The license file was moved from a seperate file to the top of this one.
- Created public "join" member function from destructor code.
- Created public "start" member function from constructor code.
- Used std::invoke_result_t to update to modern C++
- Added thread indicator as worker function parameter and
  removed futures since I'm not using them and it was difficult
  to combine that logic with a thread indicator.
